# Hi Everyone!

This is my personal webpage (http://omermindivanli.com) that use the techs on the following below. I have learnt lots of things about React and Redux development from open source community. I aimed to create a boilerplate that we can develop it together, which uses modern libraries with latest versions.

1. Eslint / Airbnb
2. Stylelint / Airbnb
3. Prettier
4. Redux
5. React
6. Travis
7. Snapshot Test
8. Lint-Staged
9. Sass
10. Material UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
