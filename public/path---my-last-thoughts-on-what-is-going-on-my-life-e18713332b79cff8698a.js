There was a operating system error. I, therefore, tried to use my ex mac, which is pretty satisfing as a personal computer, and then, I wanted to write something on my blog.</p>\n<p>You know I have started on my new job in Sweden. I am pretty satisfied with my job, workplace and team. They are quite nice people. Especially, in Sweden, People have a great respect to one another, which makes us feel like we work in job security. I strongly believe that there are millions of people are on the trouble of job security. On these days, I try to TALK swedish, which is the most important thing in Sweden, I guess but, of course, is not mandotary or as important as Danish or German. I mean if you do not know Swedish ppl do not push you or something else. They always support you to speak more and more. I LOVE SWEDISH PEOPLE SÅ MYCKET ( So much :) ) Anyways, just currently started to talk Swedish slowly. It will also help me to make new friends, as well, which triggers me a lot lol haha :)</p>\n<p>As for Tieto, my managers and colleauges are very friendly, respectful, polite and supportive and also understanding. I can always demand them like Can I have a look on that feature maybe sometime? They reply yes, of course :) They do not push me to finish something.</p>\n<p>A year ago, I have finished a back-end project. It was not node.js but I have just began to work with some back-end development stuff which is fucking exciting for me. I am really more into develop my skillset as much as I can. It makes me feel like refresh, I think. By the way, my colleauge taught me .git very well. I use it in a proper way.</p>\n<p>When it comes to life, I must confess I am a bit alone. The scandinavian lifestyle has a tonnes of useful things for people. I do not complain but it might make you maybe a tiny alone. Perhaps we can call it like individualistic. As a person who has grown up in a family-oriented society, sometimes it puts lots of pressure on me like being loneliness or somethings else… But maybe you know I am very good at finding some activities or making friends. At least I try to survive in this loneliness forest haha lol. I like Swedish people. I am sure I will learn a lot from them. In the following months, I would like to visit the U.K and some parts of Europe. I have lots of friend on the U.K. I can meet with them. That is amazing.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"What is goin' on my life...",date:"July 07, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/My last thoughts on what is going on my life/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/First Day on Tieto.../"},frontmatter:{title:"First Day on My New Job..."}},next:!1}}}});
