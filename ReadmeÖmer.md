Hi I am Ã–mer Mindivanli,
I have been trying to be a web developer for a long time. I am a self-taught developer. I really dislike narcistic actions about learning and sharing some of my exp with ppl who wanna laern smth about development and software sciences.

Roughly, A year and half, owing to some of blog posts, I thought to not using boilerplates. I believe that it was a good decision. Becasue I had to dealt with some of problems. But, along this time, besides learning lots of javaScript techs, I think I lost time. That React Boilerplate is not included React 16.0. Is it a requirement to use it? I consider no!.

I am super excited to meet with react-boilerplate. When I have a quick look to the code inside it, I said to myself that I gave super bad code bases for my customers. Now, to be honest, I am super regretful. For instance, I have never created NotFoundPage. For those reasons, Using a boilerplate might cost you high in terms of bundling maybe some of unnecessary codes or using a tonnes of lib to you do not have to. But, in order for understanding an expert look on React and Redux or Front-end techs. Those are really helpful. You can use a boilerplate ina a project and then, try to create on your own small or ideal boilerplate. I strongly believe that the way of coding is very different from dev to dev. Each of dev should learn how to handle big projects with a good codebase...

Have a nice day :) :) :) ....
