## Introducing me briefly...

Hi Everyone, My name is Ã–mer Mindivanli, 29 years old and from Turkey. I have been living all my life in Turkey until I move to Sweden in 2016. My family lives in Istanbul. Exploring new place and meeting with new people from different cultures is an exciting oppurtunity. In my homeland, There are lots of foreigners but I do not know I had no friend from China or the U.S. I mean I am very glad to move Sweden and trying to learn Swedish culture. I would share my opinions about the Swedish Culture and people in the following blog posts. They are great! :)

## Meeting with Software Development

A couple of years ago, when I was a freshman in my bachelor, I got a course which is called The Basics of Information and Communication Technologies 101. The lecture was Prof.Dr Kaan ERASLAN. He gratuaded from METU from Mining Engineering. He tried to taught us C++ with Borland Builder. Interestingly, I understood everything in that lessons in just a quick revision and then, started to build a calculator, in other word, real world programs on my own. I thought Oh Gosh! I have a talent about it. After that, He understood I was quite eager to learn such things in a short time. He gave me a assistanship in that lesson. Beacuse, My classmates did not create or implement programs that in the instructions quickly and he was the only person who knows programming to teach students. He said to me that Ã–mer you are gonna help you friends. In the first examination, I took 100 / A++ score. Everybody was shocked. Eventually, in the final exam, I got 90 score. He orginised a ceramony and was awareded me with a chocolate. The applauses were rising. It was such a great experience for me and then, he added some of your friends do not have to work their areas. They would be a developer.

The result was:

* I did not listen him. I am super regretful :) ...

I chose to improve myself in my area which is named **Material Science and Engineering** and I gratuaded from Afyon Kocatepe University as a M.Sc. as Material Scientist.
