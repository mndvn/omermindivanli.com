## Introducing me briefly...

Hi Everyone, My name is Ömer Mindivanli, 29 years old and from Turkey. I had lived all my life in Turkey until I have moved to Sweden in 2016. My family lives in Istanbul. They are so sweet.

Exploring new places and meeting with new people from different cultures is an exciting oppurtunity, I think. In my homeland, There are lots of foreigners but I do not know why I had no friend from different countries. I mean I am very glad to move Sweden and trying to learn Swedish culture. I would share my opinions about the Swedish Culture and people in the following blog posts. They are great! :)

## Meeting with Software Development

A couple of years ago, when I was a freshman in my bachelor, I got a course which is called The Basics of Information and Communication Technologies 101. The lecturer was named Prof.Dr Kaan ERASLAN. He graduated from METU, Department of Mining Engineering. He tried to taught us C++ with Borland Builder. Interestingly, I was super successful even tough I have any sort of experience n programming. I got everything in those lessons in just a quick revision and then, started to build some kind of real world programs on my own such as calculator and etc... I thought Oh Gosh! I have a talent on it. After that,He sensed I was quite eager to learn such things in a short time. He gave me a assistanship for those lessons. Beacuse, My classmates needed help to create or implement example programs that in the instructions during those lessons and he was the only person who could direct people on how to fix bugs or explain the things how it works. He said to me that Ömer you are gonna help your friends. I accepted that offer.

In the first examination, which is called visa in Turkish higher-education system, I took 100 / A++ score. Everybody was shocked. Because, the lecturer said to me that it is not a common score for my course. Eventually, in the final exam, I got 90 score. He organised a ceramony and was awareded me with a chocolate. The applauses were rising by my classmates. It was such a great honor for me and then, he added"some of your friends do not have to work their areas. They would be a developer."

But, unfortunately, The result was:

* I did not listen him and started programming a couple of years later. I am super regretful :) ...

I chose to improve myself in my area which is named **Material Science and Engineering** and I gratuaded from Afyon Kocatepe University as a M.Sc. as Material Scientist, and then, began to my Ph.D. However, due to some reasons, I gave up my Ph.D. Perhaps, I may keep it on some years later...
